# Endangered

Endangered is an educational web app designed to help educate children about endangered species on the planet, and the threats to their survival.  

This app is my first group software development project. In addition to learning about building out a more advanced web app based on Vue / JS frontend & Node / Express / Mongodb backend, I was able to learn about myself, and re-learn how to apply my existing soft skills (teamwork, communication, relationships) in the specific context of software development. 

On the technical side, at this point I was beginning to feel more comfortable with the way everything fits together around a component based web app. But in truth, the real highlight was how the team pulled together despite an initial difference in opinions with regards to our choice of brief, with each member bringing their own positive qualities. Each of us made a great contribution toward delivering a user experience which closely matched our vision for an MVP and extension features.

Though it was great to work with and learn from a group of developers at a similar stage in their journey to myself, the experience of working in a team has given me a big appetite to work in a professional team environment with experienced developers.
